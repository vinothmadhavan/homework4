The error message indicates that the model size for `cnn_planner` exceeds the allowed limit of 20 MB. This is likely due to the architecture of your CNN model, which may have too many parameters. Here are a few strategies to reduce the model size:

1. **Reduce the Number of Filters**: Decrease the number of filters in each convolutional layer. For example, you can change the number of filters from 32, 64, 128, 256 to smaller numbers like 16, 32, 64, 128.

2. **Reduce the Number of Layers**: Consider reducing the number of convolutional layers. Each layer adds parameters, so fewer layers will reduce the model size.

3. **Use Smaller Fully Connected Layers**: The fully connected layers at the end of the network can have a large number of parameters. You can reduce the size of these layers or even remove one if possible.

4. **Use Depthwise Separable Convolutions**: If your framework supports it, you can replace standard convolutions with depthwise separable convolutions, which reduce the number of parameters significantly.

5. **Prune the Model**: Pruning involves removing weights that contribute less to the model's predictions. This can be done after training to reduce the model size.

6. **Quantization**: If supported, quantize the model to use lower precision (e.g., 16-bit or 8-bit) for weights and activations.

Here's an example of how you might modify the CNN architecture to reduce its size:

```python
class CNNPlanner(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, n_waypoints: int = 3):
        super().__init__()

        self.n_waypoints = n_waypoints

        # Normalization parameters
        self.register_buffer("input_mean", torch.as_tensor([0.485, 0.456, 0.406]), persistent=False)
        self.register_buffer("input_std", torch.as_tensor([0.229, 0.224, 0.225]), persistent=False)

        # Define the CNN backbone with fewer filters
        self.conv_layers = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
        )

        # Define the fully connected layers with fewer parameters
        self.fc_layers = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(64 * 6 * 8, 256),  # Adjust the size based on the output of conv layers
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(256, n_waypoints * 2)
        )

    def forward(self, image: torch.Tensor, **kwargs) -> torch.Tensor:
        # Normalize the input image
        x = (image - self.input_mean[None, :, None, None]) / self.input_std[None, :, None, None]

        # Pass through the CNN layers
        x = self.conv_layers(x)

        # Flatten the output from the conv layers
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)

        # Pass through the fully connected layers
        x = self.fc_layers(x)

        # Reshape to (b, n_waypoints, 2)
        waypoints = x.view(-1, self.n_waypoints, 2)

        return waypoints
```

After making these changes, check the model size again to ensure it is within the allowed limit. Adjust the architecture further if necessary.



==================================================================



The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the variable `nhead` is not defined in your `TransformerPlanner` class. The `nhead` parameter is required by the `nn.TransformerDecoderLayer` to specify the number of attention heads in the multi-head attention mechanism.

To fix this issue, you need to define `nhead` as a parameter in the `__init__` method of your `TransformerPlanner` class. Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
class TransformerPlanner(nn.Module):
    def __init__(
        self,
        n_track: int = 10,
        n_waypoints: int = 3,
        d_model: int = 64,
        nhead: int = 8,  # Add nhead parameter
        num_layers: int = 6,  # Add num_layers parameter for the number of decoder layers
    ):
        super().__init__()

        self.n_track = n_track
        self.n_waypoints = n_waypoints
        self.d_model = d_model

        # Embedding for the query (waypoints)
        self.query_embed = nn.Embedding(n_waypoints, d_model)

        # Linear layer to project input features to d_model
        self.input_proj = nn.Linear(4, d_model)  # 4 because we concatenate left and right (2+2)

        # Transformer decoder
        decoder_layer = nn.TransformerDecoderLayer(d_model=d_model, nhead=nhead)
        self.transformer_decoder = nn.TransformerDecoder(decoder_layer, num_layers=num_layers)

        # Output layer to project back to 2D waypoints
        self.output_proj = nn.Linear(d_model, 2)

    def forward(
        self,
        track_left: torch.Tensor,
        track_right: torch.Tensor,
        **kwargs,
    ) -> torch.Tensor:
        """
        Predicts waypoints from the left and right boundaries of the track.

        During test time, your model will be called with
        model(track_left=..., track_right=...), so keep the function signature as is.

        Args:
            track_left (torch.Tensor): shape (b, n_track, 2)
            track_right (torch.Tensor): shape (b, n_track, 2)

        Returns:
            torch.Tensor: future waypoints with shape (b, n_waypoints, 2)
        """

        # Concatenate the left and right track boundaries
        x = torch.cat((track_left, track_right), dim=2)  # Shape: (b, n_track, 4)

        # Project input to d_model
        x = self.input_proj(x)  # Shape: (b, n_track, d_model)

        # Prepare the query embeddings
        query_embed = self.query_embed.weight.unsqueeze(1).repeat(1, x.size(0), 1)  # Shape: (n_waypoints, b, d_model)

        # Transpose x to match the expected input shape for the transformer (n_track, b, d_model)
        x = x.permute(1, 0, 2)

        # Pass through the transformer decoder
        tgt = self.transformer_decoder(query_embed, x)  # Shape: (n_waypoints, b, d_model)

        # Transpose back to (b, n_waypoints, d_model)
        tgt = tgt.permute(1, 0, 2)

        # Project to 2D waypoints
        waypoints = self.output_proj(tgt)  # Shape: (b, n_waypoints, 2)

        return waypoints
```

In this updated code, I've added `nhead` and `num_layers` as parameters to the `__init__` method of the `TransformerPlanner` class. You can adjust these parameters as needed for your specific use case.
