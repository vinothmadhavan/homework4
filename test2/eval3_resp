Certainly! Let's refine the `TransformerPlanner` class while adhering to the provided template. We'll incorporate some improvements, such as input normalization and dropout, while maintaining the structure and function signatures as specified.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class TransformerPlanner(nn.Module):
    def __init__(
        self,
        n_track: int = 10,
        n_waypoints: int = 3,
        d_model: int = 128,
    ):
        super().__init__()

        self.n_track = n_track
        self.n_waypoints = n_waypoints
        self.d_model = d_model

        # Embedding for the query (waypoints)
        self.query_embed = nn.Embedding(n_waypoints, d_model)

        # Linear layer to project input features to d_model
        self.input_proj = nn.Linear(4, d_model)  # 4 because we concatenate left and right (2+2)

        # Transformer decoder
        decoder_layer = nn.TransformerDecoderLayer(d_model=d_model, nhead=8, dropout=0.1)
        self.transformer_decoder = nn.TransformerDecoder(decoder_layer, num_layers=6)

        # Output layer to project back to 2D waypoints
        self.output_proj = nn.Linear(d_model, 2)

    def forward(
        self,
        track_left: torch.Tensor,
        track_right: torch.Tensor,
        **kwargs,
    ) -> torch.Tensor:
        """
        Predicts waypoints from the left and right boundaries of the track.

        During test time, your model will be called with
        model(track_left=..., track_right=...), so keep the function signature as is.

        Args:
            track_left (torch.Tensor): shape (b, n_track, 2)
            track_right (torch.Tensor): shape (b, n_track, 2)

        Returns:
            torch.Tensor: future waypoints with shape (b, n_waypoints, 2)
        """

        # Normalize the input tracks
        track_left = self.normalize_track(track_left)
        track_right = self.normalize_track(track_right)

        # Concatenate the left and right track boundaries
        x = torch.cat((track_left, track_right), dim=2)  # Shape: (b, n_track, 4)

        # Project input to d_model
        x = self.input_proj(x)  # Shape: (b, n_track, d_model)

        # Prepare the query embeddings
        query_embed = self.query_embed.weight.unsqueeze(1).repeat(1, x.size(0), 1)  # Shape: (n_waypoints, b, d_model)

        # Transpose x to match the expected input shape for the transformer (n_track, b, d_model)
        x = x.permute(1, 0, 2)

        # Pass through the transformer decoder
        tgt = self.transformer_decoder(query_embed, x)  # Shape: (n_waypoints, b, d_model)

        # Transpose back to (b, n_waypoints, d_model)
        tgt = tgt.permute(1, 0, 2)

        # Project to 2D waypoints
        waypoints = self.output_proj(tgt)  # Shape: (b, n_waypoints, 2)

        return waypoints

    def normalize_track(self, track):
        # Normalize the track coordinates to the range [0, 1]
        min_vals = track.min(dim=1, keepdim=True)[0]
        max_vals = track.max(dim=1, keepdim=True)[0]
        return (track - min_vals) / (max_vals - min_vals + 1e-6)  # Add epsilon to avoid division by zero

# Example usage:
# model = TransformerPlanner()
# track_left = torch.rand(16, 10, 2)  # Example input
# track_right = torch.rand(16, 10, 2)  # Example input
# waypoints = model(track_left, track_right)
```

### Key Enhancements:

1. **Normalization**: The `normalize_track` method normalizes the input track coordinates to the range [0, 1], which can help the model learn more effectively.

2. **Dropout**: Added dropout to the transformer layers to help prevent overfitting.

3. **Structure**: The code structure and function signatures are kept consistent with the provided template, ensuring compatibility with automated evaluators.

This refined version should provide a good starting point for improving the model's performance on lateral error and driving performance metrics. Remember to experiment with different hyperparameters and training strategies to further optimize the model.
