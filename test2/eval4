To address the issues with longitudinal and lateral errors, as well as driving performance, we need to ensure that the model is effectively learning the task. Here are some steps and modifications you can consider:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Ensure that the input data is preprocessed correctly. Normalization is a good start, but make sure that the data is representative of the task.

2. **Model Complexity**: The current model might not be complex enough to capture the nuances of the task. Consider increasing the model's capacity by adjusting the number of layers, the number of attention heads, or the dimensionality of the model.

3. **Training Process**: Review the training process to ensure that the model is being trained effectively:
   - **Loss Function**: Use Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression tasks like waypoint prediction.
   - **Optimizer**: Use an optimizer like Adam or AdamW with a suitable learning rate.
   - **Learning Rate Scheduler**: Implement a learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rate during training.

4. **Regularization**: Use techniques like dropout and weight decay to prevent overfitting.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

6. **Advanced Techniques**: Consider using more advanced techniques, such as attention mechanisms or hybrid models combining CNNs and transformers.

Here's a refined version of the `TransformerPlanner` class with some additional suggestions:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class TransformerPlanner(nn.Module):
    def __init__(
        self,
        n_track: int = 10,
        n_waypoints: int = 3,
        d_model: int = 128,
        nhead: int = 8,
        num_layers: int = 6,
        dropout: float = 0.1
    ):
        super().__init__()

        self.n_track = n_track
        self.n_waypoints = n_waypoints
        self.d_model = d_model

        # Embedding for the query (waypoints)
        self.query_embed = nn.Embedding(n_waypoints, d_model)

        # Linear layer to project input features to d_model
        self.input_proj = nn.Linear(4, d_model)  # 4 because we concatenate left and right (2+2)

        # Transformer decoder
        decoder_layer = nn.TransformerDecoderLayer(d_model=d_model, nhead=nhead, dropout=dropout)
        self.transformer_decoder = nn.TransformerDecoder(decoder_layer, num_layers=num_layers)

        # Output layer to project back to 2D waypoints
        self.output_proj = nn.Linear(d_model, 2)

    def forward(
        self,
        track_left: torch.Tensor,
        track_right: torch.Tensor,
        **kwargs,
    ) -> torch.Tensor:
        """
        Predicts waypoints from the left and right boundaries of the track.

        During test time, your model will be called with
        model(track_left=..., track_right=...), so keep the function signature as is.

        Args:
            track_left (torch.Tensor): shape (b, n_track, 2)
            track_right (torch.Tensor): shape (b, n_track, 2)

        Returns:
            torch.Tensor: future waypoints with shape (b, n_waypoints, 2)
        """

        # Normalize the input tracks
        track_left = self.normalize_track(track_left)
        track_right = self.normalize_track(track_right)

        # Concatenate the left and right track boundaries
        x = torch.cat((track_left, track_right), dim=2)  # Shape: (b, n_track, 4)

        # Project input to d_model
        x = self.input_proj(x)  # Shape: (b, n_track, d_model)

        # Prepare the query embeddings
        query_embed = self.query_embed.weight.unsqueeze(1).repeat(1, x.size(0), 1)  # Shape: (n_waypoints, b, d_model)

        # Transpose x to match the expected input shape for the transformer (n_track, b, d_model)
        x = x.permute(1, 0, 2)

        # Pass through the transformer decoder
        tgt = self.transformer_decoder(query_embed, x)  # Shape: (n_waypoints, b, d_model)

        # Transpose back to (b, n_waypoints, d_model)
        tgt = tgt.permute(1, 0, 2)

        # Project to 2D waypoints
        waypoints = self.output_proj(tgt)  # Shape: (b, n_waypoints, 2)

        return waypoints

    def normalize_track(self, track):
        # Normalize the track coordinates to the range [0, 1]
        min_vals = track.min(dim=1, keepdim=True)[0]
        max_vals = track.max(dim=1, keepdim=True)[0]
        return (track - min_vals) / (max_vals - min_vals + 1e-6)  # Add epsilon to avoid division by zero

# Example usage:
# model = TransformerPlanner()
# track_left = torch.rand(16, 10, 2)  # Example input
# track_right = torch.rand(16, 10, 2)  # Example input
# waypoints = model(track_left, track_right)
```

### Additional Suggestions:

- **Data Augmentation**: Augment the training data by adding noise or simulating different driving conditions to improve model robustness.

- **Evaluation and Debugging**: Visualize the predicted waypoints against the ground truth to understand where the model is making errors.

- **Advanced Architectures**: If the above steps do not resolve the issues, consider more advanced architectures or techniques, such as using a hybrid model combining CNNs and transformers.

By implementing these changes and following the training suggestions, you should be able to improve the longitudinal and lateral error metrics, as well as driving performance. Remember that model development is an iterative process, and it may take several rounds of experimentation to achieve the desired performance.
